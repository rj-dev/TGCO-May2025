Technical Justification: TotalSafeSquares() Optimization
To succeed in this competition, we focused not only on solving the problem but on solving it with maximum efficiency and clarity. Our implementation of the TotalSafeSquares() function leverages several targeted optimizations to ensure superior performance, minimal memory use, and strong scalability.

1. Smart Caching of Safety Checks
   We introduced a safety cache that stores the results of IsSafe(x, y) evaluations. This prevents redundant recalculations and speeds up traversal by reusing previously computed results for coordinates.
2. Stack Allocation for Direction Arrays
   Instead of heap-allocating the direction vectors used for grid traversal, we allocate them on the stack. This reduces memory pressure, lowers garbage collection frequency, and improves execution speed.
3. Efficient Queue Handling Using TryDequeue
   By utilizing TryDequeue from the built-in Queue<T>, we improve the responsiveness and speed of our breadth-first search. It avoids exceptions and enables safe and efficient queue operations.
4. Pre-Allocated Visited Set
   We predefine the capacity of the HashSet used to track visited nodes. This minimizes resizing operations during execution and ensures faster membership checks, which are crucial for BFS performance.
5. Bounds Checking with Unsigned Arithmetic
   Wherever possible, we use unsigned integers for coordinate values. This simplifies and accelerates boundary checks, helping the CPU avoid unnecessary branching and improving overall throughput.
6. Combined Visit Check and Insertion
   To reduce redundancy, we combine the logic for checking whether a node has been visited and adding it to the visited set into a single atomic step. This improves clarity and performance.
7. Optimized Tuple Usage
   We use tuples to represent coordinate pairs in the BFS. This provides clean syntax, efficient hashing, and streamlined state representation that benefits both readability and runtime performance.
8. Early Exit for Unsafe Starting Points
   If the starting point (0, 0) is determined to be unsafe, the function returns immediately. This avoids unnecessary computation and ensures robust handling of edge cases.
9. Static Safety Cache for Reuse
   We use a static dictionary to store previously evaluated coordinate safety results. This allows reuse across different method calls and reduces overall memory allocation and redundant logic.
   Conclusion
   Through a combination of algorithmic design, memory optimizations, and system-level efficiencies, our implementation of TotalSafeSquares() stands out as a high-performance solution. It balances correctness with speed and resource conservation â€” making it well-suited for large-scale grid analysis and an ideal candidate for competitive recognition.
